Hello! My name is Alex Yaple (pronounced like maple just swap the M with a Y). 

I am currently working as a Software/Hardware support rep looking to break into a more technical role. 

I have started my journey with joining the Philips Respironics team supporting various softwares and devices. It is where I picked up my skills in reading API calls,
reading console/network logs, diving into HTML to automate processes, creating full stack programs/tools, understanding the complexities of Microsofts SQL management
software and why SQL commands are much simpler. 

Personally, I have been working on Home Automation with Raspberry Pi 4, Zero, and Picos. 

I have created several temperature sensors using the Raspberry Pi Pico and the AHT20 sensor that reports to a MQTT broker and interacts with Homebridge. I plan on 
uploading the layout, code, and 3d printed enclosures once complete and will update accordingly. 

My goal in this approach is to create and monitor home automation. I plan on using SQL databases to store historical data to monitor trends. 

My next project is to automate our rain water collection, storage, and irrigation to our garden as we have a storage capacity of 1200 gallons. This will require the
ability to manage valves, pumps, and monitoring water levels in IBC totes. I will add/update the project as I dive into it. 

If you wish to contact me please reach out to yaplea@gmail.com.
Thank you for reading and have a great day!
